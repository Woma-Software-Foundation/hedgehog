# Hedgehog

Hedgehog is a toy dynamic programming language running on a stack-based VM.
There is a post about the implementation of this interpreter in Chinese: [Hedgehog 的设计与实现](https://yangtau.me/programming-languages/design-and-implementation-of-hedgehog.html)
The [first version](https://github.com/yangtau/hedgehog/tree/first_version) of Hedgehog is a tree-walk interpreter.

I am rewriting it...
